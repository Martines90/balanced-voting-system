       unequal concept ever existed on Earth. This idea is completely against equality and this old and toxic concept is the reason why the 99%
       has to rely blindly on their decision makers' dictated direction without having any chance to change this direction. And the root cause of
       this problem is simply the misunderstanding of the idea of voting.`}

      the reasons behind this decision... nobody cares and nobody trusts the other person. So what remains as a consequence is the illusion of the democracy.`}
