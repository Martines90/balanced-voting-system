This value can be increased by reading and understanding critical or supportive opinion pieces from different parties. The key is to encourage voters to form their own opinions by exploring diverse sources and opposing viewpoints. The formula is as follows: The value of one vote = (5 * N) * N, where N is the number of critical articles read from other parties. If a representative proposes a bill, other parties can critique or comment on it. A voter who makes the effort to understand these different positions can exert a greater influence on the outcome of the vote.'}
