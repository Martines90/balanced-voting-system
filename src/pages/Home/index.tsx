      {`Maybe at first hearing this idea sound unfair... but I have to say the "one vote equals everyone's vote" shema is the most
       unequal concept ever existed on Earth. This idea is completely against equality and this old and toxic concept is the reason why the 99%
       has to rely blindly on their decision makers' dictated direction without having any chance to change this direction. And the root cause of
       this problem is simply the misunderstanding of the idea of voting.`}

       {`The biggest issue behind a vote is it puts an equation sign between a voter who has no clue of the topic, who lives in his bubble, who is not well informed,
       who relies fake news, who is biased, etc and a person who is the complete opposite of these negatives.

       Cause of the above mentioned reason people actually can't trust the model of voting and this is the reason why it happens only once in every 4 year when elections take place.
      People trust science, trust experts, knowledge, etc, but in our voting model these values have no effect. Everyone pushes a big red or green button and the whys, the context,
      the reasons... nobody cares.

      But fortunately there is a new way.
