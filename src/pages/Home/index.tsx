      {`Maybe at first hearing this idea sounds unfair... but I have to say the "everyone's vote is equal" scheme is the most
       unequal concept that has ever existed on Earth. This idea is completely against equality and this old and toxic concept is the reason why the 99%
       has to rely blindly on their decision makers' dictated direction without having any chance to change this direction. And the root cause of
       this problem is simply the misunderstanding of the idea of voting.`}

       who rely on fake news, who is biased, etc and a voter who is the complete opposite of these negatives.`}

      People trust science, trust experts, knowledge, etc, but in our voting model these values don't exist. Everyone pushes a big red or green button and the whys, the context,
      the reasons behind this decision... nobody cares and nobody trusts the other person. So what remains as a consequence is the illusion of democracy.`}
